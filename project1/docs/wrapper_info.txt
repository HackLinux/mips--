In order to be able to continue my records-based methodology
while working within the course entity declarations and
quartus' lack of records in entity decls, I have come up with
with the following solution:

* all my test benches utilize records-based entities

* all of my blocks expose a records-based entity

* to submit my blocks for scripted grading, I write wrappers
   that take my records-based entities and expose the
   course-defined entities. lets call these records->course
   wrappers for short. these wrappers use the exact names
   as defined by the course for its approprate block

* to cope with quartus choking on records in entity decls,
   I run the `compile` command on the records->course wrapper
   making a synthesized entity with the course decls

* to be able to run my test benches on these synthesized blocks,
   I write course->records wrappers. these wrappers mean I could
   also share my records-based benches with the rest of the class
